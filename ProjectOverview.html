<h2><u>Project Overview</u></h2>


<p><b>Short Description:</b></p>

<p>WheresMyProf uses crowdsourced information to provide both professors and students an easy way to share schedule<br> 
information. This project utilizes multiple different scripting languages to help accomplish this task.

</p>

<br>


<p><b>Project Rationale:</b></p>

<p>This project was created as a way to make the lives of both students and faculty at Albion College easier. Before<br>
the creation of WheresMyProf, students at Albion College often struggled with when exactly their professors were free<br>
to meet them about school conflicts and more. Professors also often struggled with effectively getting their schedule<br>
informaton out to students. The WheresMyProf application was created to help fix these scheduling issues.
</p>

<br>

<p><b>Comaptible Hardware:</b></p>

<p>WheresMyProf is currently only compatible with desktop computers and laptops at this time. We hope to eventually<br>
be able to push this product out as an application for smart phones.
