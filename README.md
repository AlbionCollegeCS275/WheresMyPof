# WheresMyProf

WheresMyProf uses crowdsourced information to provide both professors and students an easy way to share schedule information.

This was a group project for Albion College's CS275 course, Software Development. Our group succesfully created a website that allowed users to 
to loacte where their professor was in order to contact them regarding homework, available meeting times, etc. This project was soley created during the 
pandemic, as well as placed on a Raspberry Pi server that is no longer available.
